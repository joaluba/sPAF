% This function extracts the sparse Periodicity Auditory Features
% ------------------- Input ----------------------: 
% sig_0 - single-channel waveform
% params - struct contraining feature extraction parameters (see demo file)
% ------------------- Output ----------------------: 
% feat.m3PD       - 3-dimensional matrix (channels x tested periods x time instances)
%                   containing values of the relative periodic energy for each tested 
%                   period in each frequency channel
% feat.m3PG_Etot  - 3-dimensional matrix (channels x tested periods x time instances)
%                   containing values of the total periodic energy 
%                   (total energy of 8 synchrogram windows) for those 
%                   tested periods, which fulfill the glimpse criteria, all other
%                   entries are zero
% feat.m3PG_Erel - 3-dimensional matrix (channels x tested periods x time instances)
%                   containing values of the relative periodic energy for those 
%                   tested periods, which fulfill the glimpse criteria, all other
%                   entries are zero
% feat. mE        - 2-dim matrix (channels x time instances) containing values of
%                   signal power in a given time and frequency band (estimated with a 
%                   2.5 Hz filter)
% vfc  - vector with center frequencies [Hz] of gammatone channels
% vP   - vector with tested period values [s]
% vT   - vector with time points [s] for which the analysis was done
